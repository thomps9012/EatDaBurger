# EatDaBurger

An application created using mainly SQL and sequelize to let a user create, digitally "devour", and store this information in a database. The app was created using JSON objects, HTML, a handlebars object relational mapping (ORM) configuration, node, and JavaScript. Burger information, whether devoured or not, is stored in a SQL server database and is then manipulated using ajax calls to that server. "Eat da Burger" is also deployed through heroku at https://protected-harbor-16846.herokuapp.com/.
